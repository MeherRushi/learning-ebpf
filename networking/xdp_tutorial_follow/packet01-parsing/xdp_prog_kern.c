		Okay, So My understanding is as follows. 
		
		So I am assuming that as we go down the network
		stack header for different protocols are added. And here we are concerned with packets
		that have a ethernet header. So we parse those packets and use the eth [which is a struct
		pointer to ethhdr] -> h_proto field (which is the protocol of the packet it encapsulates 
		ig) and to the get the protocol type. Then we use the bpf_htons() function and the pre-def-
		-ined constant ETH_P_IPV6 and check if it is a IPV6 type packet. As different packets are 
		numbered in different format, in the if_ether.h file we can see that ETH_P_IPV6 is numbered
		0x86DD. 

		A good reference material that I have found.

		Next step is that now that we know it is a IPV6 packet, we just have to parse it and again
		finf the type of the protocol that the data it is encapsulating has i.e if it is TCP, UDP or
		ICMP etc. 

		If we figure out that it is ICMP, go ahead and parse that as well. And ig whatver is mention-
		-ed in the readme. 
		------------------------ 
		After parsing the ICMPv6 header, it is finally time to make our decisions 
		based on the packet payload. In this case, we are interested in the sequence number. The data
		structure is quite deeply nested, but the header file also defines a convenient alias, so the 
		sequence number can be accessed as icmp6h->icmp6_sequence (but donâ€™t forget byte order conversion).

		With this, we can finally implement the drop logic mentioned above, by simply returning XDP_DROP 
		if the sequence number is even, and XDP_PASS otherwise
