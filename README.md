# Learning eBPF üöÄ

This is a demo repo where I mainly document my journey of learning eBPF and XDP.
<!-- Hey there! Welcome to my eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and XDP (Express DataPathway)
learning playground. This is where I dive headfirst into the exciting world of eBPF and document my journey. -->

## What's eBPF, Anyway?

eBPF is a revolutionary kernel technology that allows developers to write custom
code that can be loaded into the kernel dynamically, changing the way the kernel
behaves

## What's Inside?

Here's what you'll discover in this repo:

- **Code Hacks:** Explore my collection of eBPF code snippets, each tackling a unique use case or wild experiment.

- **Learning Logs:** Dive into my informal, yet hopefully insightful, documentation of eBPF concepts and quirks. It is like 
a collection of personal notes and quick fixes for issues I have faced

- **Cool Finds:** Stumble upon eBPF gems‚Äîarticles, books, and official docs that helped me along the way.

- **Lab Experiments:** Peek into my eBPF experiments and maybe even try them out for yourself. Let's learn and break things together!

## File Structure

I have built this repo based on many resources which you can find in the [Resources](##Resources) section of this readme. However, the 2 main resources that I have followed are the `learning-ebpf by Liz Rice`<!-- Need to attach link--> and `xdp-tutorial by ____`<!-- Need to attach link-->


This repo contains the following file structure :
   - basics : This folder contains the basic programs that have been implemeted in the book `learning eBPF by Liz Rize`. I believe these can be found in Ch1 to 4 and Ch7 of the book. They inlcude my exploration of the bcc compiler and the libbpf library and understanding the basics of the eBPF program, their compilation, and writing Makefiles

   - bcc : This is a sub-module, it is the clone of the bcc repo
   - bpftool : This is also a clone of the bpftool repo. This tool has been extremely helpful for debugging or loading or providing features such as map pinning etc for eBPF program
   - libbpf : This is also a sub-module that is an essential library for writing eBPF programs in restricted C

   - networking : My main aim of learning eBPF was to use it in the field of networking, mainly for security reasons. I wanted to build a open-source Layer4 DOS and DDOS mitigation system using eBPF and XDP. This is the link of the project repo. So I have spent quite a little bit of time understanding xdp and packet parsing. The dependencies that one would need to install just for eBPF are also documented inside this repo (in the xdp_tutorial follow [which has an additional dependency of libxdp + xdp-tools]). I spent a lot of time trying to install modules effienctly and setting up my path variables etc.

   The sub-directory structure of the directory is as follows:
      - Documentation : This has very rough documentaion of the extreme basics
      - ICMP_drop : This repo contains code for basic dropping of ICMP packets. This is a set of extremely basic programs to get familiar with the basics of xdp code.
      - xdp_tutorial_follow : This repo has the solutions of (currently till Packet01) of the xdp-tutorial repo
      - xdp-tutorial : This is a sub-module which is a tutorial.
