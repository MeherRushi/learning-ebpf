# Learning eBPF üöÄ

Hey there! Welcome to my eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) learning playground. This is where I dive headfirst into the exciting world of eBPF and document my journey.

## What's eBPF, Anyway?

eBPF is like magic for the Linux kernel! It lets me write custom programs and load them right into the heart of the kernel. Think of it as giving superpowers to the Linux kernel without tinkering with its source code.

## What's Inside?

Here's what you'll discover in this repo:

- **Code Hacks:** Explore my collection of eBPF code snippets, each tackling a unique use case or wild experiment.

- **Learning Logs:** Dive into my informal, yet hopefully insightful, documentation of eBPF concepts and quirks. It's like my personal diary, but for tech stuff!

- **Cool Finds:** Stumble upon eBPF gems‚Äîarticles, books, and official docs that helped me along the way.

- **Lab Experiments:** Peek into my eBPF experiments and maybe even try them out for yourself. Let's learn and break things together!

## Getting in on the Fun

To join my eBPF adventure, here's what you can do:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeherRushi/learning-ebpf.git
   ```
Explore my code snippets, learning logs, and experiments. Feel free to tinker and experiment on your own.

Share your own eBPF insights or collaborate on wild experiments. We're all learning, so let's share the knowledge!

<!-- ## Let's Collaborate!

I'm all ears for contributions and discussions. If you have cool eBPF code, tips, or just want to chat, feel free to jump in. Check out my [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the lowdown.
