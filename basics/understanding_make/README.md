# Makefile 

Okay, so I didn't about the makefiles for a very long time. It is disappointing, I concur.
But moving ahead makefiles are very instrumental in building C programs.

## What's a Makefile, anyway?

A Makefile is a powerful tool for automating the build process of your software projects. It allows you to define rules and dependencies for building, compiling, and organizing your code, making it easier to manage complex projects.

## Description

This repo will contain a lot text files with random facts, will try to organise and make the documentation better later.
