So, like we know about #include <> and #include ""

To see where the gcc compiler searches for the system directories when <>
 $ gcc -v -x c -E /dev/null

 we get a part of the output :
 #include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
 /usr/include

So, if we want to add system directories while compiling we can use -I tag while compiling and give the directory

also -iquote for the search in the "" file directory.

The ld error means that the error is the linker phase
