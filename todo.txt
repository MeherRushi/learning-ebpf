REad about the XDP onlce again
Good post by kernel function bpf_trace_printk(). Andrii Nak‐
ryiko wrote a good post on this on his blog


XDP Reference Guide that’s included as part of the Cilium project’s
documentation. If you’d like more details, the kernel documenta‐
tion describes the eBPF instructions and encoding quite clearly.

The kernel setting CONFIG_BPF_JIT needs to be enabled to take advantage of JIT compilation, and it can be
enabled or disabled at runtime with the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl setting. See the docs for more
information on JIT support on different chip architectures.

For a lot more detail on tail calls and BPF to BPF calls, there’s an
excellent post by Jakub Sitnicki on Cloudflare’s blog: “Assembly
within! BPF tail calls on x86 and ARM”.
